# ETHGlobalPrague 2025 – Decycler Project

Welcome to the collection of repositories created during the **ETHGlobalPrague 2025** hackathon by the **Decycler** team.  
Each repository corresponds to a component of our full-stack solution for smart waste detection, classification, and on-chain tracking.
